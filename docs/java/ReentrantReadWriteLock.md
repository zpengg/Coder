             * 1. If write lock held by another thread, fail.
             * 2. Otherwise, this thread is eligible for
             *    lock wrt state, so ask if it should block
             *    because of queue policy. If not, try
             *    to grant by CASing state and updating count.
             *    Note that step does not check for reentrant
             *    acquires, which is postponed to full version
             *    to avoid having to check hold count in
             *    the more typical non-reentrant case.
             * 3. If step 2 fails either because thread
             *    apparently not eligible or CAS fails or count
             *    saturated, chain to version with full retry loop.

## 连续读才会被唤醒
多个连续的读线程是一个接着一个被唤醒的，而不是一次性唤醒所有读线程
